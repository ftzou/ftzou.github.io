I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in Cognitive Neuroscience at University of Oregon co-advised by [Dr. Sarah DuBrow](https://www.dubrowlab.org/), [Dr. Ben Hutchinson](https://hulacon.uoregon.edu/), and [Dr. Brice Kuhl](https://kuhllab.com/). I am broadly interested in studying learning and memory in humans.

My PhD research focuses on understanding how the human brain represents, encodes, and retrieves information about the temporal context when events occur, and how context change and stability influence our memory. I use a combination of behavioral experiments, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and computational modeling to address these questions.

Before coming to graduate school, I was a research assistant at NYU-ECNU Institute of Brain and Cognitive Science at NYU Shanghai, where I worked with [Dr. Sze Chai Kwok](http://www.kwoklab.org/) on undertanding human metacognition (i.e. the ability to monitor one's own cognitive processes).
