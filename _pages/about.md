I am a cognitive neuroscientist interested in understanding the neural basis of human memory. 

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher working with [Serra Favila](https://sites.brown.edu/favila-lab/) at Brown University. Previously, I earned my Ph.D. in Psychology at the University of Oregon, where I worked with [Sarah DuBrow](https://www.dubrowlab.org/), [Ben Hutchinson](https://hulacon.uoregon.edu/), and [Brice Kuhl](https://kuhllab.com/). Prior to graduate school, I was a postbac research assistant at NYU-ECNU Institute of Brain and Cognitive Science at NYU Shanghai, where I worked with [Sze Chai Kwok](http://www.kwoklab.org/) on how we know what we remember.

<!--I am broadly interested in studying how the brain represents our everyday experiences. Specifically, my PhD research seeks to understand how the human brain processes and encodes the temporal context in which events occur, and how temporal context change and stability influence our memory, using behavioral, neural, and computational methods.-->
