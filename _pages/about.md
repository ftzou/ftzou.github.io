I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in Cognitive Neuroscience at University of Oregon co-advised by [Dr. Sarah DuBrow](https://www.dubrowlab.org/), [Dr. Ben Hutchinson](https://hulacon.uoregon.edu/), and [Dr. Brice Kuhl](https://kuhllab.com/). 

I am broadly interested in understanding how the brain represents our everyday experiences. My PhD research focuses on understanding how the human brain represents and encodes the temporal context in which events occur, and how temporal context change and stability influence our memory. Before graduate school, I was a research assistant at NYU-ECNU Institute of Brain and Cognitive Science at NYU Shanghai, where I worked with [Dr. Sze Chai Kwok](http://www.kwoklab.org/) on undertanding how humans decide on the fidelity of mnemonic decisions, and how the brain supports these functions.
