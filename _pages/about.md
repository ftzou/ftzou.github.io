Hello! I'm Futing.

I am a 3rd year PhD student in Cognitive Neuroscience at University of Oregon co-supervised by [Dr. Sarah DuBrow](https://www.dubrowlab.org/) and [Dr. Ben Hutchinson](https://hulacon.uoregon.edu/). I am broadly interested in studying learning and memory in humans.

My PhD research focuses on understanding how the human brain represents information about the temporal context of experiences, and how context change and stability influence our memory. I use a combination of behavioral studies, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and computational modeling techniques to address these questions.

Before coming to U. of Oregon, I was a research assistant at NYU-ECNU Institute of Brain and Cognitive Science at NYU Shanghai, where I worked with [Dr. Sze Chai Kwok](http://www.kwoklab.org/) on human metacognition (e.g. the ability to monitor one's own cognitive processes).
